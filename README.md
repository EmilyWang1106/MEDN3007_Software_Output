# MEDN3007_Software_Output

This repository contains all of my working folders and codes. 

The folders started with ITK and PPI are the folders for building the ITK master table and new master table for the 20 proteins respectively. 

There are two R projects. The MEDN3007 project was used to construct the master tables, while the MEDN3007_Software_project was used for building the machine learning models. 

The ClinVar and PPI-Hotspot folders were used to build the ClinVar and PPI-Hotspot models respectively. Inside each folder the tool file was used to incorporate the DDG values to the master table, which was done on the virtual machine. 

The ITK_test_folder folder was used to apply the machine learning models on ITK. The code to plot the heatmaps after applying the machine learning models was saved in the heat_map_plot file.
